GluonCV: a Deep Learning Toolkit for Computer Vision
========================================================

GluonCV provides implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in computer vision. It aims to help engineers, researchers, and students quickly prototype products, validate new ideas and learn computer vision.

GluonCV features:

1. training scripts that reproduce SOTA results reported in latest papers,

2. a large set of pre-trained models,

3. carefully designed APIs and easy to understand implementations,

4. community support.

Installation
------------

Install MXNet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GluonCV depends on the recent version of MXNet. The easiest way to install MXNet
is through `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_. The following
command installs CPU version of MXNet.

.. code-block:: bash

   # the oldest stable version of mxnet required is 1.4.0
   pip install mxnet-mkl>=1.4.0 --upgrade

   # you can install nightly build of mxnet to access up-to-date features
   pip install --pre --upgrade mxnet-mkl

.. note::

   There are other pre-build MXNet binaries that enable GPU support and
   accelerate CPU performance, please refer to `this tutorial
   <http://gluon-crash-course.mxnet.io/mxnet_packages.html>`_ for details.

   Some training scripts are recommended to run on GPUs, if you don't have a GPU
   machine at hands, you may consider to `run on AWS
   <http://gluon-crash-course.mxnet.io/use_aws.html>`_.

Install GluonCV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to install GluonCV is through `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

 pip install gluoncv --upgrade

 # if you are eager to try new features, try nightly build instead

 pip install gluoncv --pre --upgrade

.. hint::

  Nightly build is updated daily around 12am UTC to match master progress.

  Optionally, you can clone the GluonCV project and install it locally

  .. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv
    cd gluon-cv && python setup.py install --user
